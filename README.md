Raspberry Pi-Based Digital Dash & ECU Tuning Interface for a Race Car https://averyizatt.com/custom-car-stereo-with-tuning-integration/
This project transforms a Raspberry Pi into a powerful, multifunctional infotainment and tuning system for my 1989 Foxbody Mustang race car. It replicates the functionality of expensive standalone systems using open-source tools and custom hardware integration, all on a budget.

Overview
An open-source Android Auto emulator, OpenAuto, was adapted to operate in a race car environment. It provides:

A full graphical interface for music and navigation
Real-time tuning access to the ECU using TunerStudio
Rear camera integration
Audio output is routed through a compact 12V amplifier module connected to the factory speaker system. The result is a seamless, feature-rich digital dash system comparable to commercial race car solutions.

Key Features
TunerStudio IntegrationThe Pi connects to a Microsquirt V3 ECU via USB. TunerStudio runs locally for real-time engine monitoring, logging, and tuning.
OpenAuto InterfaceOpenAuto is used as a driver-friendly infotainment system. It's customizable and supports touch input.
Rear Camera SupportA CSI camera module (e.g. IMX219) streams live video using libcamera-vid and ffplay. A GPIO pin triggers the camera feed (e.g. reverse gear logic).
Graceful Shutdown LogicA 12V relay and 5V delay relay ensure safe shutdown when ignition is turned off. The Pi detects ACC loss via GPIO and shuts down cleanly, preventing SD corruption.
Audio IntegrationA compact amplifier module drives the car speakers with the Pi's audio output.

Bill of Materials (BOM)



Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+)
MicroSD Card (32GB+)
12V to 5V Buck Converter
Pi power supply
12V Relay
5V Time Delay Relay Module
Compact Audio Amplifier
Rear Camera (IMX219 or similar)
HDMI/DSI Display
Touch or non-touch display
USB GPS (optional)
Adds GPS logging
Useful for nav or TunerStudio logs
Misc Wiring/Fuses


How It Works

1. Startup Sequence

When the ignition turns on, the 12V relay activates.

The 5V converter and delay relay power the Raspberry Pi.

The Pi boots into OpenAuto, with TunerStudio ready in the background.

2. Rear Camera Activation

A script monitors a GPIO pin for high state.

When triggered (e.g., reverse engaged), libcamera-vid launches and streams camera output to the display.

3. TunerStudio Usage

Full tuning access to Microsquirt V3 ECU.

USB connection to the ECU for data logging, map edits, test modes.

Mimics professional tuning tools without a laptop.

4. Shutdown Sequence

Ignition off = 12V relay deactivated.

GPIO pin reads ACC as LOW.

5-minute timer begins; Pi safely shuts down.

The 5V delay relay holds power until shutdown completes.

Why This Matters

Race car dash systems with ECU logging and camera support can easily cost thousands. This project shows that with:

A Raspberry Pi

Some relays

Open-source software

You can build a modular, extensible system for under $150 that rivals commercial products.

Future Upgrades

Bluetooth OBD integration

CANbus overlays on screen

Custom UI skins or performance metrics

Integrated GPS telemetry logging
