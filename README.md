- Integration notes for OpenAuto (Android Auto implementation) and display/touch configuration.

Dependencies
- Build host: Linux (Ubuntu recommended) with standard packaging tools.
- OpenAuto and associated libraries (see subfolders for pinned versions and packaging instructions).

Usage
- Read the subfolder  where packaging scripts live; follow the exact build order and required binary versions for predictable results.
